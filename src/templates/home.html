	Hi Collins.

	I've left the styling of the homepage up to you. I added the bootstrap cdn the css.html file so it can be used across
	the sight. All you have to do is figure out how you would like the homepage to look.

	Here's a link to the bootstrap_4 documentation. 
	https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/

	I've completed my part of the project. We can go live as soon as you give me the go ahead.

	Also I think there's still an issue with the CoinDesk Scraper. I takes me to a page that doesnt display the story I clicked on. Let me know if you want me to fix it.

	Here's some links that I told you about for further Python education.

	DJANGO:

	You can also just search coding for entrepreneurs on youtube. I enjoyed their TryDjango and eCommerce series.
